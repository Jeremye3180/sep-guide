    <h2>Why do we have porfolios in SEP?</h2>

    <p>Portfolios archive your work that you have done in class so projects are eaiser to find. It also represents a huge part of your future career in software because compainies like google want to see what you are capable of in your projects.</p>

          <h1>How to make an efficient, Meaningful Pofolio for Your work!</h1>
          <div class="col-md-4"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>In order to make the most out of your portfolio, you should include, your embedded project, a way to see your code, and a MEANINGFUL reflection on the project.</p>
      <h2>Embedding your project</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Compainies want to see what you have created without going out of their way to find it on github
      </p>
      <h2>Showing your code!</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Why show our code if it allows others to use it in their own work?</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We show our code because we want others to see how we accomplished a certain aspect of our project! This way, students can learn from eachother's code and implement their findings in their own projects!</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Your reflection</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>This is where students crtique themselves on the project they have just completed. A reflection is meant to inform viewers about the purpose of the project, how the student came up with it, challenges that they faced, and their next steps.
      </p>
      <h2> Your Entry Tittle</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Lastly,do not forget to create a title for each entry that applies to the corrosponding project!</p>
      <br>

          <div class="col-md-4"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Your Logo</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Every portfolio in SEP requires you to have a logo to which you can claim your own. Make sure your logo is simplistic, original, and presntable. Ex:
    </p>
    <img id="logo" src="Olympic-logo.png">
    <img id="logo" src="Twitter_logo_blue.png">
    <br>
    <p>copyrighted by the olympics and Twitter respectively</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Styling your portfolio</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>You will be able to color your portfolio however you want as long as it looks proffessional.
You may choose what ever font style you like but make sure that there is contrast with the background colors and the font is readable</h4>
    <h4>Here is an example of a good and Bad font:</h4>
    <li id="font">This is a good font!</li>
    <li id="font2">This is a bad font!</li>
  </div>
</body>
